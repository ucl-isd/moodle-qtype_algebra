  Scenario: Backup and restore a course containing an algebra question
    When I backup "Course 1" course using this options:
      | Confirmation | Filename | test_backup.mbz |
    And I restore "test_backup.mbz" backup into a new course using this options:
      | Schema | Course name | Course 2 |
    And I navigate to "Question bank" in current page administration
    When I click on "//div[@class='dropdown']//a[contains(.,'Edit')]" "xpath_element" in the "Algebra question" "table_row"
    Then I should see "Edit question"
    When I click on "//a[@role='menuitem']//span[contains(.,'Edit question')]" "xpath_element"
    Then the following fields match these values:
      | Question name        | Algebra question                                  |
      | Question text        | P(x) = 3x and Q(x) = 4x. Calculate (P + Q)(x)     |
      | General feedback     | Generalfeedback: (P + Q)(x) = 7x.                 |
      | Default mark         | 1                                                 |
      | id_variable_0        | x                                                 |
      | id_varmin_0          | -5                                                |
      | id_varmax_0          | 5                                                 |
      | id_answer_0          | 7*x                                               |
      | id_fraction_0        | 100%                                              |
      | id_feedback_0        | This is a very good answer.                       |
