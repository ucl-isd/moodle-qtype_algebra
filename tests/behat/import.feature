  Scenario: import Algebra question.
    When I navigate to "Question bank" in current page administration
    And I select "Import" from the "jump" singleselect
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I upload "question/type/algebra/tests/fixtures/qtype_sample_algebra.xml" file to "Import" filemanager
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    Then I should see "Parsing questions from import file."
    And I should see "Importing 1 questions from file"
    And I should see "1. What is the derivative of the function \(f(x) = x^2\) ?"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I should see "Derive"
