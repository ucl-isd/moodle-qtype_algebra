Feature: Test algebra questions in combined question
  In order to evaluate students responses, As a teacher I need to
  create and preview combined (Combined) questions with algebra subquestions.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email               |
      | teacher1 | T1        | Teacher1 | teacher1@moodle.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Create, edit and preview a combined question.
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "Question bank" in current page administration
    Then I press "Create a new question ..."
    And I set the field "Combined" to "1"
    And I click on "Add" "button" in the "Choose a question type to add" "dialogue"
    Then I should see "Adding a combined question"
    And I set the field "Question name" to "Combined 001"
    And I set the field "Question text" to "What is the square of 2xy? [[1:algebra]].<br/> What is the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 f'(x) = [[2:algebra]]."
    Then I set the field "General feedback" to "The square of 2*x*y is 4*x^2*y^2 and the derivative of x^2 is 2*x."
    #And I press "Verify the question text and update the form"
    And I press "Save changes and continue editing"

    # Follow sub questions (The order of sub questions comes from the question text).
    Then I wait until the page is ready
    And I press "Blanks for 1 More Variables"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
